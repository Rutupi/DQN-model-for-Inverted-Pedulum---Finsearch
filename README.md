# DQN-model-for-Inverted-Pedulum---Finsearch
This is the repository containing my code for the DQN model implementation for the inverted pendulum for the Finsearch Project 2025. 

In this jyupter notebook, We tried to implement the DQN model for the Inverted pendulum problem given in the third week content. 

Keeping the environment and the noise intact, We have implement the Neural Networks for the Q learning .
Following that implemented the replay function and the epsilon greedy algorithm which forms the basis for the DQN.

Then Trained the model using a loop and finally visualising the results.

We have explained the detailed explanation for all the factors consider in the Markdown tab above and below the each cell containing the code.
